## What is ResQNet?

**ResQNet** is an end-to-end platform that combines **AI reasoning**, **drone swarm coordination**, and a **real-time operator dashboard** to accelerate search-and-rescue operations during natural disasters.

The system monitors social media for emerging disasters, deploys autonomous drone swarms to survey affected areas, and generates actionable rescue strategies -- all in real time.

## Operational Phases

### Phase 0 -- Monitor (Always Running)
- Scrape X (Twitter) trending topics for potential disasters using twikit
- LLM-based classification and validation of disaster signals
- Deep-dive hashtag analysis for incident details (location, severity, type)
- Persistent reasoning context across monitoring sessions

### Phase 1 -- Scout (Stage 1)
- Dispatch drone swarm to selected geo-zone via Drone Controller API
- Analyze drone frames with VLM to detect buildings, people, fire, smoke, flood
- Split scouting zone into NxN grid, map drone frames to zones
- Generate per-zone danger rating, people density estimation, and rescue priority
- Produce full rescue strategy with phases and resource allocation
- Generate escape routes and safety zone recommendations

### Phase 2a -- Search (Stage 2)
- Continuously process new drone frames for updated detections
- VLM-based medical emergency detection with automatic alarm triggers
- VLM-based threat/risk detection requiring operator attention
- Active alarm queue for real-time operator notifications

### Phase 2b -- Rescue (Stage 2)
- VLM describes scene, LLM generates safety instructions for persons on ground
- VLM tactical assessment, LLM generates operator action plan and resource requests

### Unified Agent
- Single chat endpoint orchestrates all 4 phases via LLM tool-calling
- 21 tools available across Monitor, Scout, Search, Rescue, and Drone Controller
- Agentic loop with up to 10 chained tool calls per conversation turn
- Maintains conversation history for multi-turn reasoning

## My Contributions

This project is based on the original ResQNet open-source implementation. I forked the project and extended it with a reproducible synthetic testing workflow for the Scout perception pipeline.

### What I Added

- Added a **DEMO_MODE** to the Scout service for testing the perception pipeline without requiring an external VLM API.
- Created a clearly labelled **synthetic drone dataset** containing simulated telemetry logs and test frames for four drones.
- Added deterministic synthetic VLM responses covering:
  - Buildings
  - People
  - Fire and smoke
  - Flooding
  - Vehicles
  - Debris
  - Road accessibility
- Validated the **4×4 search-zone partitioning pipeline**, producing 16 mission zones from drone telemetry.
- Validated frame-level detection using drone ID, frame number, GPS coordinates, altitude, and structured scene information.
- Added explicit labelling to ensure synthetic outputs are not confused with real drone imagery or real-world VLM analysis.

### Validation

The Scout pipeline was tested using four simulated drones with 50 frames of telemetry per drone.

Example validation:

```text
Total zones: 16
Zones with frames: 4

Drone 1, Frame 50:
GPS: x=15.0, y=7.5
Altitude: 50.0

Detected scene information:
- Buildings: 3
- People: 2
- Vehicles: 1
- Debris: detected
- Fire: not detected
- Flooding: not detected
